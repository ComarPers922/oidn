    Caffe2 uses a copyright model similar to Caffe: each contributor holds
    copyright over their contributions to Caffe2. The project versioning records
    all such contribution and copyright details. If a contributor wants to further
    mark their specific copyright on a particular contribution, they should
    indicate their copyright solely in the commit message of the change when it is
    committed.
